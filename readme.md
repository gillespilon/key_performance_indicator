# Key performance indicator (KPI)

## In brevi

Office workers usually work on creating, updating, and publishing documents. Whether it's creating presentations, responding to emails, or doing statistical analysis, they are creating documents. Unlike a manufacturing environment, their output appears invisible to an observer of their work process. If such a worker were to commit their documents to a Git repository, they could make visible their work. These commits could then be reported as a key performance indicator (KPI).

## Data
