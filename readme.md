# Key performance indicator (KPI)

## In brevi

Office workers usually work on creating, updating, and publishing documents. Whether it's creating presentations, responding to emails, or doing statistical analysis, they are creating documents. Unlike a manufacturing environment, their output appears invisible to an observer of their work process. If such a worker were to commit their documents to a Git repository, they could make visible their work. These commits could then be reported as a key performance indicator (KPI).

## Data

The data file is available [here (kpis.csv)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzrdQfHR2I5Dc0o5X3puNHUxdTQ/view?usp=sharing). It consists of a date column and six KPI data columns. Dates are entered using [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) date format (yyyy-mm-dd).

## Methodology

I will write the methodology for this repository.
